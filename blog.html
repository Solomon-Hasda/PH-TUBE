            <h2 class="text-2xl bold">1. Discussing the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`</h2>
            <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

                ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

                These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

                If i declare a variable useing 'var' this will be Global scope, I can use it from any where in my code.
                i can reassign and re-declaire. This is Global scope in js.

            </p>
            <p> If i use 'var' in a function, i can access that from out of function. other wise

            <h2 class="text-2xl bold">2. The use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h2>
            <p>'null'. null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value so that i can change it in future. I can Comparing against null to check if a value has been intentionally set to nothing.</p>
            <p>'undefiend'. undefiend is a value that represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value. ariables declared without an assignment are automatically undefined. An object has properties and values. if i want to search a property in object which property doesnt exist , i'll found undefined.  </p>
            <p>The function with parameter and i if dont provide its value it will return undefined.</p>
